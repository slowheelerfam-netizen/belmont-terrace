What's done:

NavBar.tsx ✅
sanity-content-seed.ts ✅
Files copied to public/archive/ ✅
archive-index.json generated ✅ (or run the Node script first if not done yet)

Next step:
Build the /archive browse/search page that reads archive-index.json and lets members filter by year and search by filename with download links.
